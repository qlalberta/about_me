<p>After I finished my undergraduate and master programs in China, I went to Canana and earned my PhD in biochemistry.  Although I was productive and my resume looks pretty impressive with all the publications and patent, I don't see a  meaningful career path in
 biology. Luckly, I found my passion in computer science after leaving academia and entered the apprenticeship program. I'm excited about the new career.
